The goal is to get the application to run in a browser and to capture
a screenshot of the home page as it appears in the browser.

There are three branches: `master`, `add_geocoding`, and
`connect_users_and_places`.  You should first *rebase* the
`add_geocoding` branch on top of the `master` branch, and then
fast-forward merge the rebased branch with `master`.  Do *not* simply
merge `add_geocoding` and `master`.  Fix any conflicts.  Then you
should rebase the `connect_users_and_places` branch on top of the new
`master` branch, and then fast-forward merge the rebased branch with
`master`.  Again, fix any conflicts.

Once the merges are complete, you need to add a migration to the
project that adds a string attribute called "name" to the `User`
model.  Add this migration, and any other code changes to the `master`
branch.

There may be bugs in the code.  Fix any bugs you find.

To complete the task, push the `master` branch to GitHub, run the
application, and capture a screenshot of the home page.  Send me the
screenshot.

$ git push origin master
$ ./script/server
